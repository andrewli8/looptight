# Self-improvement status

This is looptight's bounded running plan. Keep only the current objective,
validated results, and at most six executable tasks. Git history is the archive.

## Objective

Make looptight the smallest reliable validation and task protocol shared by
Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode. The default path runs inside the user's
existing CLI session and makes no model or API calls of its own.

## Loop

1. Plan from repository evidence and user-facing friction.
2. Keep small tasks with observable acceptance conditions under `Next`.
3. Execute the highest-value task in the current agent session.
4. Require `looptight verify --json` to return `pass`.
5. Commit and push the coherent result, then update this file.
6. Stop successfully when `looptight next` returns `NO_WORK`.

## Validated

- `verify --json` schema v1 distinguishes pass, fail, timeout, and error.
- `next --json` schema v1 returns one grounded task or `NO_WORK`.
- Both protocols are provider-neutral and make no agent or network calls.
- Atomic task claims are shared privately across Git worktrees, recover after
  24 hours, and disappear when their source task is no longer grounded.
- `init --integrate` installs the same bounded session loop for Codex and
  OpenCode (`AGENTS.md`) and Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`) without child agents.
- `status --json` reports validation readiness, workspace safety, claims, and
  the next action without running checks or changing state.
- `run` requires explicit `--headless`; deprecated `improve` no longer launches
  agents. Current-session docs make no provider-billing promises.
- Generated reflection, local cost gating, and the duplicate autonomous
  orchestrator are removed; legacy flags and `improve` return migration guidance.
- The runtime is standard-library-only; plain human output and versioned JSON
  require no Rich/Markdown dependency chain.
- Runtime contracts, summaries, adapters, and CLI contain no lesson or cost
  telemetry fields; deprecated TOML keys are safely ignored.
- Queued tasks require nonempty source evidence and an explicit observable
  acceptance condition before `next` can claim them.
- Command handlers are separated from the machine-facing protocol; the stable
  CLI surface is unchanged, `commands.py` remains below 250 lines, and its
  `__all__` exports only public command handlers.
- Proposal discovery (`discovery.py`) and ranking (`ranking.py`) are separate
  single-concern modules; `propose.py` only composes them, and `propose`/`next`
  JSON output is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Status discovery enforces the documented six-task maximum while preserving
  executable task order.
- Package metadata and entry-point docs describe Looptight as a validation-gated
  task protocol, without learning, teaching, or autopilot claims.
- `next` rejects dirty Git worktrees before proposal or claim mutation, returns
  a machine-readable error with exit code 2, and remains unchanged outside Git.
- `next` reconciles claims against current task evidence even when the queue is
  empty, so completed work cannot leave contradictory active-claim status.
- Verifier shell launch codes 126/127 are execution `error` results with CLI
  exit 2; ordinary nonzero test verdicts remain `fail` with exit 1.
- Verifier timeouts terminate the spawned process tree before returning while
  retaining bounded partial stdout/stderr in the timeout result.
- Lint discovery uses only an already-installed `ruff` executable; it never
  invokes `uv`, installs packages, writes an environment, or accesses a network.
- Ruff discovery disables its cache, keeping `propose` free of repository state
  mutations while preserving the same lint candidates.
- Explicit `swarm --headless` uses a deterministic manager, distinct atomic
  claims, isolated worktrees, bounded concurrency, and serialized verified merges.
- Cross-worktree tests prove nonempty queues pass through `ClaimStore`; explicit
  task-selection control flow prevents duplicate workers from receiving one task.
- `swarm --json` emits a versioned schema with overall status, per-worker task
  IDs/status/errors/worktree paths, and the push outcome for automation.
- Human swarm output prints retained failed/conflicting worktree paths, and
  preparation errors remove only detached worktrees that never started a task.
- Provider invocations have an explicit wall-clock timeout that terminates the
  process tree and retains the worker worktree with a distinct timeout result.
- `ui` serves a dependency-free, read-only, loopback-only node graph from
  versioned Git-private swarm state with polling and restrictive browser headers.
- The graph supports pointer and keyboard node inspection plus read-only status
  filters; every projection redraws its dependency arrows without mutating state.
- Concurrent worker results publish in completion order for timely observation;
  verified integration and returned results remain ordered by worker number.
- Submitted workers publish a running state before result collection, so the UI
  distinguishes queued preparation from active provider execution.
- Atomic state publications include a backward-compatible UTC event timestamp;
  the UI reports its age without inferring provider health from elapsed time.
- Explicit continuous swarm mode repeats verified rounds and uses an isolated
  provider planning pass only when grounded work is exhausted; accepted plans
  are bounded, evidence-path validated, status-only, and verified twice.
- Planner evidence cannot cite the generated status file itself; rejected plans
  leave the invoking worktree clean and retain only their isolated worktree.
- Project configuration is limited to `verify`, explicit `tasks`, and
  `direct_main`; configured files feed grounded discovery and unattended runs
  refuse the primary worktree unless explicitly allowed.
- Swarm workers stage only task-attributable paths, and stable task fingerprints
  prevent equivalent discovery routes from relaunching completed work.
- Interrupting a swarm terminates registered provider process trees before the
  executor unwinds, preventing orphaned subscription-consuming workers.
- Remote mobile management has a security decision record: prefer provider-native
  control, otherwise require an identity-aware tunnel while retaining loopback.
- `Config` declares each field exactly once (`direct_main` deduplicated) under a
  frozen-dataclass round-trip test; ranking weights place configured `task-file`
  candidates above ad-hoc `todo` and `status-next` signals.
- `install_session_instructions` tolerates a START marker without END, `parse_score`
  is typed for optional output, and `Checkpointer.diffstat` returns empty on git
  failure — each covered by a regression test.

## Next

No grounded follow-up is currently queued. Continuous mode delegates the next
evidence-backed planning pass to the selected provider only after this queue is
empty.

## Rules

- Validation outranks activity: no evidence means `NO_WORK`, not a new audit.
- Only a valid task claim plus a passing verifier may authorize a commit.
- Never record idle runs, generated lessons, token consumption, or repeated
  review logs here.
- Replace completed tasks with validated outcomes; do not append a changelog.
