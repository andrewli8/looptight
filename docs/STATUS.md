## Correction to the spec (June 2026)

The spec predates Claude Code's `/goal` (shipped ~May 2026), so it treated only
Codex as having a native loop. Reality:

- **Claude Code** has `/goal`, drivable headlessly via `claude -p "/goal …"`.
  looptight drives it with `--native`.
- **Codex** runs headless via `codex exec`. Its `/goal` (the stable `goals`
  feature, default-on in Codex 0.141.0) is *not* an eval-gated loop: it's an
  interactive objective + token-budget tracker the model self-manages via
  `create_goal`/`update_goal`. The tool takes only `objective` and
  `token_budget` (no verify command), gates on a token budget and a
  self-assessed status, and is a TUI slash command — the headless entry,
  `codex exec`, takes a prompt, not slash commands. Driving it as a native loop
  would mean self-grading, which principle 3 forbids, so we keep supplying the
  loop around `codex exec` and `supports_native_loop` stays `False`.
- **opencode** runs headless via `opencode run`; no goal primitive → supply.

The design absorbed this cleanly: `verify` is always the ground-truth oracle, so
supply and delegate produce identical summaries and both write lessons.

## What's wired

All three adapters are real and shell out to their confirmed headless commands
(`claude -p` / `codex exec` / `opencode run`); Claude additionally drives `/goal`
under `--native`. The whole control flow is unit-tested with injected fakes (no
agent, no network); the opt-in `tests/e2e_test.py` exercises a real agent.

Known limitations: Codex JSON output reports token usage, not USD cost, and
opencode JSON output is still unobserved here. Those runs are bounded by the
iteration cap rather than the dollar ceiling unless a model/pricing conversion
is added; cheap-model reflection (D3) is wired for Claude (`haiku`) and falls
back to the default model elsewhere.

## Next

1. ~~Confirm whether Codex `/goal` can be driven headlessly.~~ Resolved
   (Codex 0.141.0): `/goal` is a self-graded objective + token-budget tracker,
   not a headless eval-gated loop, so `supports_native_loop` stays `False` — see
   the correction above. (Re-check if a future Codex `exec` gains a
   verify-gated loop primitive.)
2. Decide whether to add token-to-USD pricing for observed `codex exec --json`
   usage events; observe `opencode run -f json` before attempting opencode cost
   parsing.
3. Record the flagship gif: the same command across agents, then a second task
   that benefits from a lesson written in the first run.
