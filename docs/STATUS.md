# Self-improvement status

This is looptight's bounded running plan. Keep only the current objective,
validated results, and at most six executable tasks. Git history is the archive.

## Objective

Make looptight the smallest reliable validation and task protocol shared by
Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode. The default path runs inside the user's
existing CLI session and makes no model or API calls of its own.

## Loop

1. Plan from repository evidence and user-facing friction.
2. Keep small tasks with observable acceptance conditions under `Next`.
3. Execute the highest-value task in the current agent session.
4. Require `looptight verify --json` to return `pass`.
5. Commit and push the coherent result, then update this file.
6. Stop successfully when `looptight next` returns `NO_WORK`.

## Validated

- `verify --json` schema v1 distinguishes pass, fail, timeout, and error.
- `next --json` schema v1 returns one grounded task or `NO_WORK`.
- Both protocols are provider-neutral and make no agent or network calls.
- Atomic task claims are shared privately across Git worktrees, recover after
  24 hours, and disappear when their source task is no longer grounded.
- `init --integrate` installs the same bounded session loop for Codex and
  OpenCode (`AGENTS.md`) and Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`) without child agents.
- `status --json` reports validation readiness, workspace safety, claims, and
  the next action without running checks or changing state.
- `run` requires explicit `--headless`; deprecated `improve` no longer launches
  agents. Current-session docs make no provider-billing promises.
- Generated reflection, local cost gating, and the duplicate autonomous
  orchestrator are removed; legacy flags and `improve` return migration guidance.
- The runtime is standard-library-only; plain human output and versioned JSON
  require no Rich/Markdown dependency chain.
- Runtime contracts, summaries, adapters, and CLI contain no lesson or cost
  telemetry fields; deprecated TOML keys are safely ignored.
- Queued tasks require nonempty source evidence and an explicit observable
  acceptance condition before `next` can claim them.
- Command handlers are separated from the machine-facing protocol; the stable
  CLI surface is unchanged, `commands.py` remains below 250 lines, and its
  `__all__` exports only public command handlers.
- Proposal discovery (`discovery.py`) and ranking (`ranking.py`) are separate
  single-concern modules; `propose.py` only composes them, and `propose`/`next`
  JSON output is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Status discovery enforces the documented six-task maximum while preserving
  executable task order.
- Package metadata and entry-point docs describe Looptight as a validation-gated
  task protocol, without learning, teaching, or autopilot claims.
- `next` rejects dirty Git worktrees before proposal or claim mutation, returns
  a machine-readable error with exit code 2, and remains unchanged outside Git.
- `next` reconciles claims against current task evidence even when the queue is
  empty, so completed work cannot leave contradictory active-claim status.
- Verifier shell launch codes 126/127 are execution `error` results with CLI
  exit 2; ordinary nonzero test verdicts remain `fail` with exit 1.
- Verifier timeouts terminate the spawned process tree before returning while
  retaining bounded partial stdout/stderr in the timeout result.
- Lint discovery uses only an already-installed `ruff` executable; it never
  invokes `uv`, installs packages, writes an environment, or accesses a network.
- Ruff discovery disables its cache, keeping `propose` free of repository state
  mutations while preserving the same lint candidates.
- Explicit `swarm --headless` uses a deterministic manager, distinct atomic
  claims, isolated worktrees, bounded concurrency, and serialized verified merges.
- Cross-worktree tests prove nonempty queues pass through `ClaimStore`; explicit
  task-selection control flow prevents duplicate workers from receiving one task.
- `swarm --json` emits a versioned schema with overall status, per-worker task
  IDs/status/errors/worktree paths, and the push outcome for automation.
- Human swarm output prints retained failed/conflicting worktree paths, and
  preparation errors remove only detached worktrees that never started a task.
- Provider invocations have an explicit wall-clock timeout that terminates the
  process tree and retains the worker worktree with a distinct timeout result.
- `ui` serves a dependency-free, read-only, loopback-only node graph from
  versioned Git-private swarm state with polling and restrictive browser headers.
- The graph supports pointer and keyboard node inspection plus read-only status
  filters; every projection redraws its dependency arrows without mutating state.
- Concurrent worker results publish in completion order for timely observation;
  verified integration and returned results remain ordered by worker number.
- Submitted workers publish a running state before result collection, so the UI
  distinguishes queued preparation from active provider execution.
- Atomic state publications include a backward-compatible UTC event timestamp;
  the UI reports its age without inferring provider health from elapsed time.
- Explicit continuous swarm mode repeats verified rounds and uses an isolated
  provider planning pass only when grounded work is exhausted; accepted plans
  are bounded, evidence-path validated, status-only, and verified twice.
- Planner evidence cannot cite the generated status file itself; rejected plans
  leave the invoking worktree clean and retain only their isolated worktree.
- Project configuration is limited to `verify`, explicit `tasks`, and
  `direct_main`; configured files feed grounded discovery and unattended runs
  refuse the primary worktree unless explicitly allowed.
- Swarm workers stage only task-attributable paths, and stable task fingerprints
  prevent equivalent discovery routes from relaunching completed work.
- Interrupting a swarm terminates registered provider process trees before the
  executor unwinds, preventing orphaned subscription-consuming workers.
- Remote mobile management has a security decision record: prefer provider-native
  control, otherwise require an identity-aware tunnel while retaining loopback.
- `Config` declares each field exactly once (`direct_main` deduplicated) under a
  frozen-dataclass round-trip test; ranking weights place configured `task-file`
  candidates above ad-hoc `todo` and `status-next` signals.
- `install_session_instructions` tolerates a START marker without END, `parse_score`
  is typed for optional output, and `Checkpointer.diffstat` returns empty on git
  failure — each covered by a regression test.
- The read-only dashboard shows an at-a-glance status tally, `swarm` prints a
  one-line outcome count after per-worker lines, and `next` human output includes
  each task's acceptance condition — each covered by a test, JSON unchanged.
- The dashboard shows idle empty-state guidance, `status` prints the resolved
  verify command, and `swarm` prints a start banner naming workers/agent/verify
  before the silent run — each covered by a test, JSON output unchanged.
- `doctor` prints actionable hints when verify or an agent is missing, and the
  dashboard inspector re-resolves the selected node each poll so its detail stays
  live — each covered by a test.
- Diagnostic output is clearer: run summaries surface the actual error, the claude
  adapter names the return code on native non-zero exits, the continuation context
  marks truncated verify output, settings hook errors name the actual type, and
  Makefile `test:` detection ignores commented lines.
- The dashboard event age reads in hours and days past an hour, and `propose`
  human output groups candidates by source priority — each covered by a test,
  JSON output unchanged.
- `ClaimStore.select` treats a claim with a non-string `task_id` as stale instead
  of raising `TypeError`, covered by a regression test.
- `is_git_repo` and `is_git_primary_worktree` have direct coverage proving real
  repo/non-repo detection and the primary-vs-linked-worktree distinction, with no
  production code change.
- Usage-limit detection honors an absolute wall-clock reset ("resets at 3:00pm")
  relative to an injected current time, rolling to the next day when already past,
  and falls back to relative/back-off otherwise — covered by tests.
- Idea generation is the default on an empty queue: `next` returns `no_work` with a
  `generate_ideas` directive (shared `prompts.PLANNING_GOAL`) so the host session
  generates grounded tasks; `swarm --continuous` plans via its subagent. `--no-ideas`
  / `idea_generation = false` restores stop-on-empty. looptight makes no model call.
- Ranking places human-curated `task-file`/`status-next` above automated `lint`/
  `todo`; `next` task JSON no longer triplicates the task text (`goal` is the
  summary, `evidence` the pointers, `acceptance` separate). Each covered by tests.
- The native delegate loop (`run --native`) shares the supply loop's usage-limit
  resume via a common `_with_limit_resume` wrapper: a provider limit during a
  driven loop waits (capped) and retries instead of stopping. Off by default;
  covered by tests, supply-loop behavior unchanged.
- Consecutive usage-limit resumes are boundable (`limit_max_resumes`, 0 = unbounded
  default) in both the single loop and the continuous swarm, so a perpetual limit
  signal stops with a clear error instead of looping forever. Covered by tests.
- `_summary_and_evidence` has direct coverage proving inline `Evidence:` refs are
  split out of the summary (single and multi-ref) and that marker-less candidates
  fall back to their detail line, with no production change.
- The SPEC output contract documents the optional `next` `directive` field
  (`generate_ideas` on `no_work`), additive and absent under `--no-ideas`.
- `owner_id` (env override and default identity) and config.py's `find_config` and
  `render_config` now have direct unit coverage.
- Continuous swarm can wait out a provider-reported usage/rate limit and resume
  (`--resume-on-limit`, off by default): a shared adapter failure helper classifies
  the limit, back-off prefers the provider's named reset and is capped so the loop
  re-polls a long reset instead of sleeping unbounded. No token or billing tracking;
  `limits.py` is pure stdlib. Each piece covered by a test, default behavior unchanged.
- The single-agent headless loop (`run --headless --resume-on-limit`) waits out a
  provider usage limit between iterations without consuming an iteration-cap slot,
  sharing `limits.limit_wait`; swarm and single-round behavior unchanged. Covered by
  tests. The orchestrator topology and unattended recipe are documented in
  `docs/architecture.md` and `README.md`.
- Interrupting a swarm now publishes terminal `interrupted` manager and active-worker
  state after stopping owned provider processes, so the read-only dashboard does not
  retain a historical `running` state. Covered by a regression test.
- Successful worker-worktree removal now also removes its empty per-run swarm
  directory; no-work and completed rounds leave no directory litter, while failed
  workers retain their recovery worktrees. Covered by swarm regression tests.
- CLI parsing directly covers non-positive swarm worker counts and provider
  timeouts, returning argparse exit code 2 with no production-code change.
- Usage-limit parsing directly covers out-of-range absolute reset times, which
  remain classified as limits without inventing a retry interval.
- A repository-private SQLite coordinator foundation now initializes schema v1
  transactionally under Git's common directory with WAL, foreign keys, uniqueness
  constraints, bounded busy handling, repository isolation, and rollback coverage.
- Coordinator task leases: unique run IDs and fenced SQLite leases whose generation
  rejects renewal/completion by stale owners; `next`/`status` route through the
  coordinator with unchanged JSON; ten same-directory processes claim distinct tasks.
- Repository integration serializes behind an advisory lock over one coordinator-owned
  detached worktree per target ref; user worktrees are never touched; cross-process
  exclusion and worktree validation are covered.
- Verified swarm branches drain through a durable FIFO integration queue (fenced
  enqueue, oldest-first under the lock, CAS ref advance, atomic terminal lease/task
  transitions); stale fences are superseded; swarm JSON unchanged.
- Integration crash recovery is idempotent via `Looptight-Integration-ID` trailers
  (`reconcile` yields exactly one reachable result across every boundary); publication
  is separate, fetches first, finalizes without a second push, and never force-pushes.
- Concurrent planners deduplicate equivalent proposals; `status` projects coordinator
  counts additively; activation fails closed against live legacy claims (marker written
  last); the WAL first-open race is retried. A 10-process acceptance suite is covered.
- `looptight migrate` activates the repository coordinator from the CLI: writes the
  marker, refuses (exit 2) while live legacy claims exist, errors outside Git, is
  idempotent, and emits `--json` — covered by tests, other command JSON unchanged.
- `run_swarm` reconciles any integration left `integrating` by a crashed prior run
  before claiming new work (`_reconcile_pending` → `Integrator.reconcile`), so a crash
  finalizes to exactly one reachable result — covered by an after-commit crash test.
- `swarm --push` publishes merged integrations through the durable `Publisher`
  (`_publish_via_queue`): fetch-first, exact-SHA, no force, idempotent — covered by an
  end-to-end test against a bare remote; the legacy direct push remains a fallback.
- `looptight migrate` and coordinator activation are documented in README and
  architecture (activation, fail-closed, idempotent, outside-Git error).
- `finish_integration` conflict path has direct coverage: the fenced lease is released
  and the task requeues while attempts are below the cap, then fails at the cap and is
  no longer claimable.
- Coordinator runs carry a usable heartbeat: `heartbeat` refreshes an active run and
  `reap_abandoned` marks runs whose heartbeat predates a deadline `abandoned` and frees
  their leases (tasks requeued) before TTL — covered by a time-injected test.

## Next

(Coordinator round-2 complete. Queue empty — `next` returns `no_work` with a
`generate_ideas` directive; the session adds grounded, evidence-backed tasks and
continues.)

## Rules

- Validation outranks activity: no evidence means `NO_WORK`, not a new audit.
- Only a valid task claim plus a passing verifier may authorize a commit.
- Never record idle runs, generated lessons, token consumption, or repeated
  review logs here.
- Replace completed tasks with validated outcomes; do not append a changelog.
